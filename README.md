# mysql

First we initialize the document using Node
![image1] (/images/image1.png?raw=true)


We are given a selection of products to purchase
![image2] (/images/image2.png?raw=true)


In this case we will use ID #* (underwear) and purchase 22 of these.
![image3] (/images/image3.png?raw=true)


It then asks if we would like to place another order.
![image4] (/images/image4.png?raw=true)

If user selects yes it runs the list of products again. Note that ID #8 now says 378 instead of 400. We wont be making an actual purchase here.
![image5] (/images/image5.png?raw=true)


If user says No the order closes with a nice little message for the user.
![image6] (/images/image6.png?raw=true)
